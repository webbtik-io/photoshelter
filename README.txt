# PhotoShelter Module

This module is meant to integrate photo's stored on PhotoShelter onto your site. It does not copy your photo files to your server, but allows you to access and display them from your Drupal site. Each photo, gallery, and collection on your PhotoShelter site is saved as a type of symlink with meta data as a PS Photo, PS Gallery, or PS Collection. Sites in the "List on Site" category in your PhotoShelter are the only ones that will be copied over.
